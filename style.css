MAKE SURE TO READ BELOW BEFORE GETTING STARTED FOR THE FIRST TIME!

You may be thinking…

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA... WHERE ARE THE STYLES?

But before you freak out, let me take a few minutes to explain.

Scaffolding uses Compass ( http://compass-style.org/ ) (and by extension, SASS) by default. If you prefer using regular CSS, then feel free to modify this theme how you like and keep a copy as your own personal starting point.

DON'T DISMISS IT JUST YET THOUGH, USING SASS ISN'T AS COMPLICATED AS YOU THINK.

It does take a few minutes to wrap your head around, but it will all be worth it. Need a quick intro? Here are a few quick reads:

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you are going to be working with SASS, that you work locally.

That being said, here is the guide to installing compass.

If you need a GUI for it, we recommend using Scout.
Scout: (Windows / Mac Users)
https://mhs.github.io/scout-app/

These applications compile Sass into valid CSS. This
way you can keep your production files easy to read and your
CSS minified and speedy. Simply set the output to the
css folder and you are all set. It's a thing of beauty.

> Ready to get down to business? Head over to scss/styles.scss for more info on how to get started with styling.

Remember, once you download scaffolding it's up to you how to use it,
so go nuts. Set things up and develop in a way that's easiest for you.

Happy Developing!
