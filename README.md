**Description**

Scaffolding is designed to make the life of developers easier. It is built using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It is developed with the goal of providing a starting point for every responsive WordPress theme that we build.

Scaffolding is designed to utilize all the best tools across the web -
from the _s starter theme by Automattic, to Bootstrap\'s grid structures, and common WordPress helper functions.
